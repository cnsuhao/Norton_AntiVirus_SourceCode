# From: Roderick Schertler <roderick@gate.net>

# Subject: POD lines with only spaces
# 
# There are some places in the documentation where a POD directive is
# ignored because the line before it contains whitespace (and so the
# directive doesn't start a paragraph).  This patch adds a way to check
# for these to the pod Makefile (though it isn't made part of the build
# process, which would be a good idea), and fixes those places where the
# problem currently exists.
#
#  Version 1.00  Original.
#  Version 1.01  Andy Dougherty <doughera@lafcol.lafayette.edu>
#    Trivial modifications to output format for easier auto-parsing
#    Broke it out as a separate function to avoid nasty
#	Make/Shell/Perl quoting problems, and also to make it easier
#	to grow.  Someone will probably want to rewrite in terms of
#	some sort of Pod::Checker module.  Or something.  Consider this
#	a placeholder for the future.
